# My notes
Server: The program
Client: Terminal application
Web application: HTTP request

Client connects to the server and once connected they can communicate back and forth.

To test the server we can use web browser (test page) and automated test driver (JUnit tests).

A server has two pieces: a website and a web API.

API: Application Programming Interface (we will use a RESTful API).

Tip: study phase 3 first and then study phase 2.

Phase 3:
When creating the Dao classes store information in a map.

1. Work on the webpage to be able to use the test webpage.
2. Pick one of the API functions and get it working end to end (maybe register).
3. Write unit tests as you go.
4.
