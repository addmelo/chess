# My notes
Server: The program
Client: Terminal application
Web application: HTTP request

Client connects to the server and once connected they can communicate back and forth.

To test the server we can use web browser (test page) and automated test driver (JUnit tests).

A server has two pieces: a website and a web API.

API: Application Programming Interface (we will use a RESTful API).

Tip: study phase 3 first and then study phase 2.
